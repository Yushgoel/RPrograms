This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{js}
$('.navbar-inverse').removeClass('navbar-inverse').addClass('navbar-default');
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(flexdashboard)
library(highcharter)

```
```{r}
data = fread('../R/train.csv')
```


Train Data
=======================================================================

```{r}
valueBox(nrow(data), icon="fa-table", color="rgb(100, 200, 100)")
```


```{r}
valueBox(ncol(data) - 2, icon = "fa-table", color = "rgb(100,200,100)")
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
